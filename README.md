# ðŸŒŒ BN Field Hypothesis: A Playful Theoretical Exploration  

> *"What if mass behaves like electric charge in Maxwell's equations?"*  

This repository documents my **thought experiment** about a hypothetical vortex field (**BN field**) that couples to gravity through torsion.  
**Core idea**: Flowing mass/energy generates a gravitational "magnetic" field (BN), which in turn affects matter motion.

## ðŸ§© Key Concepts  
1. **BN Field** (`Bâ‚™`):  
   - A vortex field induced by **time-varying gravity** (`âˆ‚g/âˆ‚t`) and **gravitational currents** (`J_g`).  
   - Analogous to magnetism in EM, but for mass.  

2. **Gravitational Current** (`J_g`):  
   - Represents **mass/energy flow** (like electric current for charges).  

3. **Force Law**:  
   ```math
   \mathbf{F}_{BN} = m (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}_N)
   ```  
   *(Velocity-dependent, like Lorentz force)*  

## ðŸ¤– Collaboration Note  
- **My role**: Physical intuition, hypothesis formulation.  
- **DeepSeek's role**: Mathematical rigor, equation validation.  

## ðŸŒ  Why "Playful"?  
This is **not a formal theory** but an open-ended exploration. Like Einstein's gedankenexperiments, it asks:  
*"What if gravity has hidden degrees of freedom?"*  

**Join the discussion!** Fork this repo or open an Issue to critique/extend the idea.
